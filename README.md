# Task Management App - Quang Bui

## Overview

This is a simple task management application built as part of the Frontend Programming course (CSCI 6333 - Assignment 03). The app allows users to add, complete, delete tasks, and view task statistics. The main objective is to practice using core React hooks, such as useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useRef, useMemo, and useCallback, as well as to implement a custom hook for data persistence with localStorage.

## Feature
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by entering a title.
- **Complete/Uncomplete Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete individual tasks from the list.
- **Task Statistics**: The app displays the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.
- **User Context**: Simulates user-specific tasks by including a user login context.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Uses useCallback and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Persist Tasks**: A custom hook (useLocalStorage) is used to save tasks to localStorage, allowing them to persist across page reloads.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
